# WorkWeek by Pink Pumpkins
WorkWeek is a desktop application that allows for simplified management of employee records pertaining to scheduled shifts, punched hours, time off requests and approvals, write-ups/corrective actions, and options to anonymously report incidents of harassment, unsafe work practices, or violation of company standards.

## About WorkWeek
<!--Answers the following questions:
- What was our motivation?
- Why are we building this?
- What problems does it solve?
- What are we learning?
- What makes our project stand out? (include a list features)-->
The WorkWeek desktop application is built around the idea that schedule management within a company should be simple for employees, as well as whosoever manages their shifts.  Our team is motivated by the desire to create a piece of software that is beneficial to all levels of employment within a company, which includes the company owners, management/administration, and lower-level employees.  We are building this software because we as a team collectively agree that existing schedule management software doesnt perform to our standards and that we can create a schedule management app that allows for better ease of access and control of scheduled shifts.  The WorkWeek desktop application solves the issue of schedule conflicts by simplifying the system of schedule management by allowing a manager to assign shifts to employees, checking whether an employee's shift conflicts with another, allowing the employee to request time off, offer a selected shift to a co-worker, or accept a shift that a co-worker has offered, and allowing a manager to approve or deny scheduling requests made by employees.  Our team is learning very much about programming software that involves the management of time.  WorkWeek stands out from other scheduling applications because it allows employees to trade their shifts with each other.

The WorkWeek desktop application allows employees to view thier schedules, request time off, offer their scheduled shifts to co-workers, claim offered shifts, view hours worked, calculate pay, and make anonymous reports to administrators.  It also allows administrators to create logins for employees, edit employee schedule and pay information, approve or deny shift cancellations or exchanges, and view anonymous reports.  The application also allows higher-ups to look up employee information.
